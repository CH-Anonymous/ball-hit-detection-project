Ball Hit Detection Project
This project is part of a Python Machine Learning Jam and is designed to detect when a tennis ball hits a designated area on a wall and translate the hit to a virtual white screen. Both the physical frame and virtual screen maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Project Overview
The system uses a webcam to detect ball hits within a taped-off frame on a wall. When a hit is detected, it translates the point of impact onto a corresponding virtual white screen on the computer. This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world problems like motion detection and mapping in a creative, scalable way.

Core Features
Frame Setup: A 16:9 aspect ratio frame is created on a wall using colored tape, and the system can scale between a minimum of 32 inches diagonal to 200 inches diagonal.

Ball Hit Detection: Detects tennis ball hits inside the frame using image processing and displays the corresponding location on a virtual white screen.

Impact Visualization: The hit is visualized by a black circle displayed on the white screen at the exact point of impact.

Calibration: The system calibrates to any frame size within the supported range, ensuring accurate mapping between the physical and virtual frames.

Noise Reduction: Strategies are implemented to reduce false positives, ensuring only actual hits are detected.

System Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (for image processing)
Numpy (for array manipulation)
Webcam
Tennis balls
Colored tape for creating the frame on the wall
Installation Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ball-hit-detection-project.git
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Before running the project, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python
Step 3: Run the Project
Run the ball_hit_detection.py script:

bash
Copy code
python src/ball_hit_detection.py
Setup Instructions
1. Create the Frame on the Wall
Use colored tape to create a 16:9 aspect ratio frame on the wall.
The frame can be any size within the range of 32 inches diagonal to 200 inches diagonal.
Example size: 32 inches diagonal, which is approximately 28 inches width x 15.75 inches height.
2. Position the Webcam
Set up your webcam facing the framed area.
Ensure the camera captures the entire frame clearly.
3. Run the Python Script
The script will use the webcam to detect ball hits within the frame.
Hits are visualized as black circles on a virtual white screen displayed on your computer.
How It Works
Frame and Camera Calibration: The system first calibrates the frame and maps the frame's dimensions onto the virtual white screen.
Ball Hit Detection: When a tennis ball is thrown at the wall, the system uses image processing (via OpenCV) to detect any changes in the frame, especially identifying movements (the ball).
Impact Point Mapping: Once a hit is detected, the point of impact is calculated and then visualized as a black dot on the virtual white screen, maintaining proportionality with the physical frame.
Noise Reduction: The system uses various filters and thresholding techniques to minimize false positives caused by other movements or lighting changes.
